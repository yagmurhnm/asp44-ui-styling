# Discussion and self-evaluation
The whole methodology and individual sections will be evaluated in this part.
It will include reflections on the process and highlight elements that could have been improved.

## Market research
Despite several applications being tested in this study,
it appeared later that transport applications had not been included in this batch.
It would be interesting to include this group of applications in a future analysis
because they have many similarities in choosing existing routes and progressing through a booking process.
This analysis could be pushed further by considering applications in other sectors like hotel or restaurant booking.

## Requirements elicitation
Considering the time constraint and the availability of many pre-existing research papers 
(including both qualitative and quantitative data) about running and related themes,
the decision has been made not to elaborate a new custom survey for data gathering.
However, given a wider timescale, a custom survey would be valuable to get more granular data and provide specific questions
leading to requirements elicitation. This elicitation process was primarily accomplished through prototypes and literature in the work approach presented. It might also be interesting to gather more data from individuals experiencing loneliness by conducting interviews.

## Limits of user-centered design : 
We often noticed there could be a conflict between what users want and the original concept developed by the team.
A good balance should be found when involving users in the decision process.
Some ideas and preconceptions are widely spread in society. They can sometimes manifest in the responses collected through surveys.
For instance, one survey result indicated that users preferred the blue interface.
It has been shown that there is a large proportion of people who have a preference for this colour.
However, does that mean the majority's predilections should guide every decision ?
Numerous successful products have broken existing norms and disrupted common thinking.

## Prototyping
One of the difficulties encountered during the prototyping process was acquiring users' feedback during the first low-fidelity iterations.
It is essential to get feedback early to avoid starting to work in the wrong direction.
However, during the early stages, it is quite challenging to get users to understand the prototype's objectives
and ask questions on a static draft because they expect something more functional and detailed.
The use of a card-based prototype has not been integrated, but it is a technique that would probably enhance the effectiveness
of these early steps of testing.

This work adopted an empirical approach with multiple iterations of surveys
to refine the user interface. However, many publications within the UX field
have been made to explain what solutions tend to be more effective and efficient.
These resources have probably been underused in the decision-making process regarding
the layout of the interface elements, such as buttons, or the choice of fonts or colours.

## User testing
The outcome of the SUS survey gave a general usability score, but it did not let
precisely understand which items were working well and which needed improvement.
The data gathered through observations were much more valuable as they permitted to clearly state
the application's flaws and collect the user's feelings. It performed better than surveys.
It is something that has been taken into consideration late in the process.
Having few known users (family or friends) is also more efficient, whereas surveys require
more time to elaborate and obtain answers. The second phase of this project will rely on this observation.

SUS survey and observations have been conducted in parallel.
It was preferable to make the observations before the SUS survey
to update the prototype from observation notes before assessing the survey.

## Project conduct
The role distribution with a responsibility given for each section has been quite effective.
This method should be followed during the second phase, if it is still relevant.

## Heuristic evaluation
The heuristic evaluation was initially planned to be done at the end.
It has been moved just before the middle fidelity prototype because, at this stage,
the prototype was sufficiently advanced to be evaluated, and all issues detected
during the evaluation could be corrected before the user testing.
However, it should be noted that all issues have not been solved before user testing
as the timeframe was too tight.
