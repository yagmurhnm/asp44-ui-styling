# Project management
## General organisation
### Communication
The team gathers on Google Meet once a week on Monday at 7 pm (London time).
From week 6, it has been decided to increase the meeting pace to twice weekly to speed up the work.
The second meeting in the week is always planned on Thursday at 7 pm (London time).

Generally, the Monday meeting is a checkpoint to see work progression, discuss ongoing themes,
organise the work for the next week and answer different team members' questions.
The Thursday meeting is more oriented to be a workshop session. It means that members work on one or several topics together
in a live collaborative session to end up with a finished work on a particular task. Meetings commonly have a duration from 1 to 2 hours.

During meetings, the team uses a shared Google Document or Jam.
Video recording and auto-transcripts have been used to let members retrieve information if needed.

The Slack channel has been used between meetings to share work progress and get team feedback.
The work done from the current week is sent over the channel several hours before the meeting to let members
review it and prepare questions or comments.

### Tasks distribution
Considering the high occupation of each member from work and other modules, the organisation has been flexible but effective.
General milestones and progression goals have been fixed, however any highly detailed timing and trackers have been used.

An action plan has been set up and weekly updated on Google spreadsheet to clearly state which
task is assigned to which member.

Early weeks were focused on achieving tasks from the course.
Then, as the team progressed, goals became more evident, and the work was organized to converge toward the midterm report.

### Tools
A Google Drive folder gathers all the work done and documents emanating from the team.
All surveys have been elaborated through Google Forms.

This midterm report has been written using markdown files converted to pdf (with Pandoc), and version controlled with Git.
Zotero is used to manage references and Bibtex for the bibliography.
A standard Citation Style Language file from IEEE is used to format references.
