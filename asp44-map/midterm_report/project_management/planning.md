## Planning
### Original timescale
A general timescale was first set up to get an overview of phases over time.

More time has been distributed to the following phases :

- **Market research** : it requires some deep research and analysis
- **Prototyping** : expected to be long because of the iterative process
- **Report writing** : arrange each piece of the report correctly, reference sources, and proofreading the final document is time-consuming

### Milestones
- **May 25th** : Deliver the project scope and framing
- **May 30th** : Users are defined
- **June 1st** : Deliver the market study and first rough sketches of the UI
- **June 2th** : Provide a list of requirements
- **June 16th** : First prototyping and feedback pass is done
- **June 17th** : Heuristics evaluation on the second low-fidelity prototype
- **June 19th** : Deliver an interactive prototype
- **June 22th** : Specifications and architecture
- **June 26th** : Users tested the interactive medium fidelity prototype
- **June 30th** : Final prototype
- **July 3th** : Midterm report delivery

### Project risk analysis

### Schedule adjustments
Many adjustments have been made during the process :

- The overall research on the topic has been extended to one additional week
because some pieces of information were missing, and some questions were still not answered in detail.
- Requirements elicitation spans over more than three weeks.
It happened early in the project, but then updating some requirements from user feedback was necessary.
- The design modeling phase was expected to be long but finally took even more time in the schedule.
The choice to assess multiple surveys was highly time-consuming as it required elaborating questions, waiting for users to answer, then compiling data,
and reflecting on the next iteration.
- The heuristics evaluation has been moved before the user testing to filter and eliminate some existing flaws
and avoid users encountering them during the test.
- User testing was initially planned earlier on a lower fidelity prototype, but testing usability on sketches prototypes did not make sense. 
Therefore it has been scheduled after the middle fidelity prototype, which is also more convenient for testing because of its interactivity.

All these adjustments delayed the midterm report delivery to the beginning of week 12 instead of week 10.
There was a little warm-up delay on week 4 for the team to set up everything and organise itself before starting to work effectively.

### Final GANTT chart
The following GANTT chart captures the state of the project on week 11.
It had been modified and adapted multiple times along the progression.
