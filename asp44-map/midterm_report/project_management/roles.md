## Roles
Roles have evolved along the progression.
As the deadline approached, tasks were more split to allow parallel work and to be more efficient.
In the last weeks before the midterm deadline, roles have been distributed, with each team member being responsible
for the achievement and progression of one fundamental axe of the project :

- **Anh is responsible for heuristics evaluation** :
  - Conduct the assessment of prototypes
  - Ensure the overall quality of the proposal
  - Define user acceptance criteria
- **Barry is responsible for prototyping**
  - Conduct the design modeling phase
  - Design prototypes and follow user-centered design principles
  - Elaborate surveys
- **Florian is the team leader** :
  - Organise team activities and meetings, write reports
  - Guide and frame the project
  - Conduct the research and market study

\newpage
- **Maxime is responsible for the user testing** :
  - Manage relations with groups of users
  - Select appropriate methodologies
  - Assess surveys and compile data feedback
- **YaÄŸmur is responsible for the requirements elicitation**:
  - Conduct the requirements elicitation process,
  - Elaborate features and build the software architecture
  - Select technical solutions and define specifications

However, everyone contributes broadly, and each topic is discussed with the whole team during weekly meetings.
Members are responsible for one part but do not individually produce all the content of the part.
