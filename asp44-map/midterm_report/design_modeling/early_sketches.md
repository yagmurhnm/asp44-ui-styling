# Design modeling
## Early sketches

Sketches drawn up after the initial brainstorming session are visible in the appendix.
After some discussion, a more refined sketch was created using Excalidraw to visualise a possible desktop (web-based) application, 
as well as a mobile application.

The team ultimately decided to focus on designing and developing a mobile application.
A web-based desktop application would be able to provide most of the functionality defined for this application (such as creating and managing bookings). However, it would not prove to be a useful platform for other requirements, such as movement tracking.
