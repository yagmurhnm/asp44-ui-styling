## Medium fidelity prototype
For the medium fidelity prototyping phase, an interactive prototype was created using Axure (whereas the first two iterations of 
low-fidelity prototypes were "sketched" using Excalidraw). This prototype was also created alongside the second iteration 
of the low-fidelity prototype (colour-scheme and style). Therefore, some survey responses were not yet considered 
when designing this prototype. However, this was done to get an interactive example of the app into the hands of users as quickly as 
possible to test the overall usability of the application. These results were then gathered using a SUS survey, as well as observations 
which were conducted with users, in person, by the team memebers.
