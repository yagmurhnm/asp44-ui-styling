## Low fidelity prototype - Second iteration
After receiving feedback from users regarding the application layout design, we created a new survey focusing on the application's colour scheme and other nuanced details, such as the style of the icons 
the user uses to navigate through the application. The designs used in the survey are included below.

**Colour Scheme:**
Colour palettes can play a significant role in a user's perception of an application, both psychologically and emotionally[@RoleColorUX].
Although one could argue that this is a subjective aspect of design, more universal aspects of colour choices can affect 
how an application comes across to users. It is particularly true when considering users of differing cultures, where specific colours 
can have illicit contradictory feelings depending on whom you ask and where they are situated across the globe[@RoleColorUX].
Putting this into consideration, the following base colours were chosen as options for users to select from:

- Orange: often associated with adventure, youth, and energy[@RoleColorUX].
  It is also one of the main colours used in one of the market leaders in this sector, Strava.
- Purple: historically associated with wealth and royalty, purple can also convey feelings of mystery, spirituality, and creativity[@RoleColorUX]
- Blue: often associated with loyalty and trust, although particular shades can vary the potential meaning of the colour.
  Darker shades of blue sometimes convey themselves as depressing and sad. However, blue is stated to be the most popular colour in the world,
  which makes it a great candidate for creating an atmosphere that is globally appealing[@RoleColorUX]

Another reason for selecting these colours is that they appear triadically on the colour wheel.
It presents an interesting use case in which all three colours could be harmonized together.[@WhatColorTheory]

**Colour Persistence When Booking:**

Since the routes users can select are colour-coded (much like a train/subway map), whether the bookings prompts should conform 
to the overall colour scheme or the colour of the route was also a consideration we included in the survey to determine what users would consider 
to be the better option.

The rest of the design options incorporate variations in the style of the icons. Users then present us with information on which styles 
they find most appealing
