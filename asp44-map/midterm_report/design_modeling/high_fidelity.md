## High fidelity prototype
With the surveys and user testing completed, a final high fidelity prototype was created using Figma. This prototype took all 
user feedback into consideration. It incorporates the layout, colour, style and control-flow processes which needed to be included, 
or adjusted. The complete Figma design is included in appendix, with arrows dictating the control-flow between processes and user interactions.
