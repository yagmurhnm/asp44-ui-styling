# Conclusion
The current work stated the prevalence of loneliness in urban areas through existing studies.
A solution has been searched to spark opportunities for people to meet each other,
and running across the public space has been identified as an appropriate medium to answer this problem.

This choice of activity oriented the solution towards a mobile application.
The conduct of a market research focused on three main themes (sport, social, location-based game) has evidenced a gap between existing applications.
Concomitantly, literature permitted gathering data, defining users, and identifying their needs, leading to eliciting requirements.
Existing studies brought surprising results evidencing that running activity was widely spread in a highly educated population that perceived high salaries.
In order to attract a wider population and trigger interest in the non-runners population, gamification has been proposed in the application. 

Analysis has shown that users primarily sought fun, togetherness, and willingness to exercise.
What follows from this statement is the need to create a common place and time for users to join a running group session.
This requirement has been fulfilled with the proposition of predefined routes in the city.
Implementing this concept led to the elaboration of several core features of the application, such as a map to visualize where
the routes are located, a booking system to join a session, and user profiles integrating game components and details.

Multiple prototypes have been designed using a user-centered approach.
User feedback guided major decisions in the application, such as choosing Google map style, cards booking list, or bottom navbar.

A heuristic evaluation filtered existing issues in the interface, such as missing status to guide the user.

A batch of iterative surveys and observations piloted the refinement of the user interface.
Formal and detailed specifications have been set to prepare the project's building phase.
The choice of a technical architecture has been made using Ionic framework and Capacitor for the front-end design.
The back-end will be achieved using Node.js, express, and a MySQL database.

This report has also shown how the schedule of the first phase has been organised, considering risks with the elaboration of a contingency plan.

At last, this preliminary work provides a complete well-defined project answering the initial research question and is ready to be built
on the project's second phase. The application building phase is limited to a two months timescale involving a team of five students,
which does not permit extensive development of many features.
However, the minimum viable product proposed in this report should be a strong foundation for future work and extensions.
