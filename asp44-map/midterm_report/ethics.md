As the application collects data from users (gender, age, name), privacy must be ensured.
A particular point to be considered is the geolocation tracking of devices.
It should not lead any other users or malicious people to know where the users are situated at any time.
The communication between the application and the back-end server
should be carefully protected against any possible attack that might lead to personal data leaks.

As the service lets unknown individuals meet each other, the possibility of potential malicious behaviors has been considered.
Minimum participants in a session and informative messages about safety before the meeting has been discussed.
The application should protect users and take all possible measures to prevent harassment cases or physical threats.
The time range of this project will be relatively limited to plainly address the safety issue.
However, it should be considered in detail if the application is developed in the future.
