  abstract = {The French existentialist philosopher, Simone de Beauvoir, long ago signalled the potentially empowering force of outdoor exercise and recreation for women, drawing on feminist phenomenological perspectives. Feminist phenomenological research in sport and exercise, however, remains relatively scarce, and this article contributes to a small, developing research corpus by employing a feminist phenomenological theoretical framework to analyse lived experiences of running in `public' space. As feminist theorists have argued, such space is gendered and contested, and women's mobility remains constrained by fears of harassment and violent attack. Running also generates intense pleasure, however, and embodied empowerment. Drawing on findings from two separate but linked automethodological running research projects, here I explore salient and overlapping themes cohering around lived experience of pleasure and danger in both urban and rural spaces.},

However, more research into the mechanisms that facilitate user engagement and its consequences is needed. Drawing on the self-system model of motivational development, this study investigates how gamification might foster user engagement and positive marketing outcomes. Data from 276 users of a mobile gamified app were analyzed using partial least squares regression. The results showed that gamification increases user engagement through satisfaction of the needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness. User engagement, in turn, leads to greater intention to use, disseminate WOM about, and to positively rate, the app. Finally, this study provides a number of theoretical and practical implications that can help developers design more effective gamified mobile apps.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To inform health behavior intervention design, we sought to quantify loneliness and its correlates, including social media use, among adults in the United States. Design: Cross-sectional research panel questionnaire. Setting: Responses were gathered from individuals in all 50 states surveyed via Internet from February 2018 to March 2018. Participants: A total of 20 096 US panel respondents aged 18\th. Measures: The University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale (theoretical score range {$\frac{1}{4}$} 20-80) was administered along with demographic, structural, cognitive, and behavioral items. Analysis: After calibrating the sample to population norms, we conducted multivariable linear regression analysis. Results: The overall mean survey-weighted loneliness score was 44.03 (standard error {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.09). Social support (standardized b [sb] {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0.19) and meaningful daily interactions (sb {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0.14) had the strongest associations with lower loneliness, along with reporting good relationships, family life, physical and mental health, friendships, greater age, being in a couple, and balancing one's daily time. Social anxiety was most strongly associated with greater loneliness (sb {$\frac{1}{4}$} \th 0.20), followed by self-reported social media overuse (sb {$\frac{1}{4}$} \th 0.05) and daily use of text-based social media (sb {$\frac{1}{4}$} \th 0.03). Conclusion: Our findings confirm that loneliness decreases with age, and that being in a relationship as well as everyday behavioral factors in people's control are most strongly related to loneliness. Population health promotion efforts to reduce loneliness should focus on improving social support, decreasing social anxiety, and promoting healthy daily behaviors.},

  abstract = {Judged by the sheer amount of global media coverage, loneliness rates seem to be an increasingly urgent societal concern. From the late 1970s onward, the life experiences of emerging adults have been changing massively due to societal developments such as increased fragmentation of social relationships, greater mobility opportunities, and changes in communication due to technological innovations. These societal developments might have coincided with an increase in loneliness in emerging adults. In the present preregistered cross-temporal meta-analysis, we examined whether loneliness levels in emerging adults have changed over the last 43 years. Our analysis is based on 449 means from 345 studies with 437 independent samples and a total of 124,855 emerging adults who completed the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale between 1976 and 2019. Averaged across all studies, loneliness levels linearly increased with increasing calendar years ({$\beta$} = .224, 95\% CI [.138, .309]). This increase corresponds to 0.56 standard deviations on the UCLA Loneliness Scale over the 43-year studied period. Overall, the results imply that loneliness can be a rising concern in emerging adulthood. Although the frequently used term ``loneliness epidemic'' seems exaggerated, emerging adults should therefore not be overlooked when designing interventions against loneliness.},

While many methods focus on competition and individual users' interaction with the game, the aspect of social interaction and how users play games together in a group remains an open subject. To investigate these issues, we developed a mobile game, HealthyTogether, to understand how users interact in different group gamification settings: competition, cooperation, or hybrid. We describe the results of a user study involving 18 dyads (N=36) over a period of two weeks. Results show that users significantly enhanced physical activities using HealthyTogether compared with when they exercised alone by up to 15\%. Among the group settings, cooperation (21\% increase) and hybrid (18\% increase) outperformed competition (8\% increase). Additionally, users sent significantly more messages in cooperation setting than hybrid and competition. Furthermore, physical activities are positively correlated with the number of messages they exchanged. Based on the findings, we derive design implications for practitioners.},

  abstract = {This dissertation offers the first study of contemporary uses of running as a form of transport. Recognising its omission from academic policy literature, two manifestations of running-transport were explored over the course of this project. Surveys and a mix of go-along and ordinary interviews were used to gain understandings of run-commuting. This practice we deemed to be an emerging commuting mode in which run-commuters have undergone an active reimagining of what commuting is and the value of travel-time. Mostly used for time-efficiency by utilising incumbent moments of mobility to undertake running training; run-commuting was also used to provide opportunities for time-out, to transition between work and home as well as explore and engage with the local environment. Run-commuting was also found to be a practice heavily reliant on other forms of mobility to actualise it and a range of end-of-trip facilities to help overcome the vast logistical issue that run-commuting poses. The second form of running-transport under investigation was that of emergency-running which are unplanned, extemporaneous and often undesired moments of mobility that people perform when in lieu of other means and with a necessity to get from A to B. An ethnography of emergency-running in a train station was undertaken and highlighted the way in which the material site of the train station, social interaction with other station users and the embodied experiences of running all coalesced to encourage and discourage emergency-running in different ways. These two elements were brought together to show the pervasiveness of running-transport and the range of people who utilise it in contemporary societies in order to undertake an appraisal of running as a transport mode. Recognising its limits in distance, speed and likeability, running was deemed to offer an important alternative active form of transport for local urban mobility that could be encouraged through awareness-raising and the provision of end-of-trip facilities. This research has also invited a greater academic and policy engagement with running-transport, setting out an agenda for future research and highlighting the academic debates it can engage with. 2},

Design: The top 50 ranked free health and fitness applications were downloaded. Gamification elements were predetermined through literature review, and applications were evaluated for their presence. Setting: App Store by Apple Inc. Measures: Presence of gamification, type of game element, and use of behavioral economic principles. Analysis: We classified the types and frequencies of targeted behaviors and features of gamification. Use of behavioral economic principles focused on designing rewards or points using loss aversion (allocated upfront and could be lost), variable reinforcement (not allocated constantly), and probability inflation (using drawings or lottery designs). Results: Gamification was used by 64\% of mobile applications. Most applications that included gamification (97\%) targeted behaviors related to physical activity and weight loss. Applications focused on other areas such as reproductive health, meditation, and sleep used gamification less often (11\%). Game elements used most commonly included goal setting (78\%), social influences (78\%), and challenges (63\%), while less common elements included points (6\%) and levels (3\%). No applications incorporated behavioral economics principles specified in the study. Conclusions: Gamification was commonly used by popular health and fitness mobile applications, but none used the specified behavioral economic principles to design rewards or points. Mobile applications could potentially improve their use if their design better leveraged principles from behavioral economics.},

However, to date, little attention has been paid to understanding the perspectives, needs, expectations, and experiences of potential users with physical activity mobile apps. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the features that are judged to be important for engagement with a physical activity mobile app and the reasons for their importance. Methods A qualitative focus-group methodology with elements of co-design was adopted in this study. Participants reporting sedentary lifestyles and willingness to improve their physical activity behavior through mobile technology were recruited. The focus group sessions consisted of 13 participants (8 men and 5 women, mean [SD] age 41.9 [7.1] years). Two researchers conducted the data analysis independently by using the inductive thematic approach. Results Four main themes emerged in relation to the research question and were named as follows: ``physical activity participation motives,'' ``autonomy and self-regulation,'' ``need for relatedness,'' and ``smart.'' Additionally, 2 subthemes originated from ``physical activity participation motives'' (ie, ``medical guidance'' and ``weight loss and fitness for health'') and ``smart'' (ie, ``action planning'' and ``adaptable and tailored''). Conclusions Features enhancing autonomy and self-regulation and positively affecting health and physical well-being as well as the need for relatedness, adaptability, and flexibility should be considered as core elements in the engagement of potential users with physical activity mobile apps. The emerged findings may orient future research and interventions aiming to foster engagement of potential users with physical activity apps.},

  abstract = {This thesis broadens current understanding of how location-based games can promote meaningful social interaction in citizens' own neighbourhoods. It investigates social cohesion and the role of social interaction to its promotion, delves into which requirements users have for playing in their neighbourhood and with its citizens, and takes a technical perspective into how this type of games should be designed to be successful at triggering interaction in public space. From this understanding, which stems from adolescents and adults from Rotterdam and The Hague, NL, a specific design and prototype of a location-based game is proposed and tested. This thesis addresses several gaps found in the current body of knowledge. On the one hand, meaningful interactions are person-dependent, can occur in various forms, and their impact on societies is not well understood. On the other hand, it is not well understood how to build location-based games for such aim: it is not known which requirements should be considered, attempts to build location-based games are often a product of in-house development not centred early on around users, no known guidelines exist for meaningful social interaction, and no consensus exists on what to consider when building location-based games from a technical perspective.This thesis offers learnings on how to best design location-based games to promote interaction that matters to local communities. It firstly offers an overview of social cohesion and how multiple factors and actors have the power to influence local communities. It then argues that meaningful social interaction bears the power to break down stereotypes and prejudice, empowers people's agencies to act, has a positive impact on cohesion, emerges at people's own pace, and addresses conflict. From this, it dives into the preferences, needs and desires of adolescents and adults to better understand what sorts of interactions are meaningful to them. This thesis explores throughout several case studies the requirements that these target groups have, and advances gameplay dynamics and game activity types that location-based games should implement to be successful at inviting meaningful social interaction in public space. These case studies also research different sorts of interaction that each game activity type invites players to have, and elicit specific game ideas that are particularly tailored around perceived-to-be socially challenging neighbourhoods in The Netherlands. These case studies culminate in the recommendation of several guidelines to be used at different stages of the game design: gameplay requirements, guidelines for meaningful social interaction to occur in the studied groups, and the sorts of game activities that designers should include to invite specific forms of social interaction. This thesis also proposes a systems architecture with key architectural components, to drive consensus and inform on what to consider when building location-based games for this purpose from a technical perspective.The lessons learned that are advanced in this thesis help practitioners design location-based games that are more tailored to what future players want to play, and help researchers understand what it means to design for meaningful social interaction in any public space around the world. Players have distinct preferences with regard to the ways they are exposed to their own neighbourhood, and the forms of interaction they would rather experience. Understanding this, and incorporating such preferences in game design, lead to gameplay experiences that can have a positive effect on societies, as they have the power to promote interaction and positive relationships in local communities. These gameplay experiences invite individuals to come together and have meaningful interactions in a playful way, (re)engage with their own neighbourhood, and be part of their local community.},

Recently, there has been a growing interest in the use of game principles in non-game contexts to make an activity that is perceived to be challenging, tedious or boring more enjoyable. With increased enjoyment through the infusion of game elements, it is expected that individuals will be more motivated to partake in the activity. Given this backdrop, the present study seeks to ascertain the utility of gamification for promoting exercise among individuals. We used Fitocracy as the gamification platform. Our results suggest that gamification improves not only attitudes towards and enjoyment of exercise but also shapes behavior in terms of increase in exercise activity. These findings augur well for gamification platforms and their usefulness in motivating exercise among individuals. Finally, our work suggests design implications for applications that aim to gamify exercise.},

As their running careers unfold, many runners become inspired not so much by fitness and health but by other corollaries of running, such as capacity to endure high levels of pain and exhaustion or novel bodily experiences. As I show in the ethnographic example of Estonian runners, a ``low-resolution'' explanation of such a shift in runners' motivations allows it to be understood in conventional terms of addiction. Three symptoms commonly highlighted in definitions of exercise addiction \textendash{} tolerance, continuance, and withdrawal \textendash{} were particularly salient in the careers of many interviewed runners. However, the reasons for developing these symptoms were not merely psycho-physiological and their implications were not clear-cut which calls for a more nuanced approach to runners' bodily experiences, the meanings attributed to these, as well as running addiction and its relationship with health and well-being.},

Yet people experience different levels of loneliness throughout the day depending on their surrounding environment. In the present study, we investigated the associations between loneliness and social and environmental factors (i.e. overcrowding, population density, social inclusivity and contact with nature) in real-time. Ecological momentary assessment data was collected from participants using the Urban Mind smartphone application. Data from 756 participants who completed 16,602 assessments between April 2018 and March 2020 were used in order to investigate associations between momentary feeling of loneliness, the social environment (i.e. overcrowding, social inclusivity, population density) and the built environment (i.e. contact with nature) using multilevel modelling. Increased overcrowding and population density were associated with higher levels of loneliness; in contrast, social inclusivity and contact with nature were associated with lower levels of loneliness. These associations remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, education and occupation. The positive association between social inclusivity and lower levels of loneliness was more pronounced when participants were in contact with nature, indicating an interaction between the social and built environment on loneliness. The feeling of loneliness changes in relation to both social and environmental factors. Our findings have potential implications for public health strategies and interventions aimed at reducing the burden of loneliness on society. Specific measures, which would increase social inclusion and contact with nature while reducing overcrowding, should be implemented, especially in densely populated cities.},

During this time, much has been claimed about the potential health-related benefits from participating, but comparatively little attention has been given to the social reasons for attending. The aim of this study was to better understand the meanings of participation for both runners and volunteers using an intrinsic case study that focused on a specific event, Colwick parkrun in Nottingham, England. Building on literature that positions leisure sites as third places, the article seeks to enhance our understanding of parkrun as a community-based initiative. Data collection included observation, participant observation, semi-structured interviews (N = 19), and a survey (N = 235). Several themes emerged, suggesting that participation in parkrun provides an inclusive leisure space for casual sociability, as well as facilitating a shared experience of exercising with others.},

  abstract = {Recreational running is increasingly widespread and could therefore be seen as the obvious target for those hoping to encourage greater public health through exercise. Existing qualitative research on this topic has, however, tended to focus on groups of highly committed runners. It is accordingly unclear whether their findings can be extrapolated to the much larger population of comparatively casual runners. This existing work has also tended to emphasise the social nature of the activity in particular ways. Whilst much recreational running happens alone, most commonly these studies have centred on the establishment of shared identities and group subcultures. Drawing on a study involving accompanied runs and interviews with recreational runners who do not belong to running clubs in London, this paper presents an alternative account. These respondents were relatively uninterested in the idea of proper running technique, ambivalent about the presence of others when running, and reticent about being pulled into a more committed collective practice. In view of how these more casual runners may be of particular interest to public health promoters, this finding suggests future campaigns might do well not to focus too greatly on the potential enjoyments of running community membership and start instead with a different set of social dynamics.},

The results indicate that perceived enjoyment and usefulness of the gamification decline with use, suggesting that users might experience novelty effects from the service. The findings show that women report greater social benefits from the use of gamification. Further, ease of use of gamification is shown to decline with age.

  abstract = {Background With increasing urbanisation, the role of urban density on mental wellbeing has gained importance. However, the evidence linking housing density, a fundamental attribute of urban built environment, with loneliness and social isolation has been scarce. We examined associations of neighbourhood housing density with loneliness and social isolation in a UK-wide cohort by using the high-resolution UK Biobank Urban Morphometric Platform (known as UKBUMP) database created by our team. Methods We leveraged data from UK Biobank, a cohort of adult participants aged 37\textendash 73 years recruited between 2006 and 2010. Neighbourhood housing unit density was objectively measured within a walkable scale of 1km and 2km street catchments of participant's geocoded dwelling (equivalent to approximately a 10-min and 20-min walk). Other built environment factors, including density of public transport, traffic intensity of the nearest street, terrain variability, street-level physical walkability, and greenspace, were also modelled. A series of logistic regression models examined the associations of housing density with loneliness and social isolation after rigorous adjustments for built environment and sociodemographic covariates. Restricted cubic spline models were used to examine non-linear associations. We stratified analyses by sex and age. Ethical approval was received by the UK Biobank from the National Health Service National Research Ethics Service and data access for the study was approved by the UK Biobank Scientific Committee. Findings Our study comprised 478 265 participants (260 641 [54{$\cdot$}5\%] of whom were women) with complete data on either outcome and housing density. 281 418 and 291 190 participants remained after full adjustment in models of loneliness and social isolation, respectively. Each 1000 units per km2 increment in housing density within a 1 km residential street catchment was independently associated with an increase of 3{$\cdot$}7\% (OR 1{$\cdot$}037 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}02\textendash 1{$\cdot$}05], p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) and 17{$\cdot$}4\% (1{$\cdot$}174 [1{$\cdot$}16\textendash 1{$\cdot$}19], p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) in odds of loneliness and social isolation after full adjustment. The results remained consistent for a catchment of 2km. A non-linear dose-response was observed. The association between housing density and loneliness was more pronounced among participants aged 50\textendash 59 years (participants aged {$<$}50 years: OR 1{$\cdot$}108 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}97\textendash 1.26], p=0{$\cdot$}1171; 50\textendash 59 years: 1{$\cdot$}188 [1{$\cdot$}06\textendash 1{$\cdot$}33], p=0{$\cdot$}0023; {$\geq$}60 years: 1{$\cdot$}114 [0{$\cdot$}99\textendash 1{$\cdot$}25], p=0{$\cdot$}0646 for the highest housing density quartile vs the lowest; pinteraction=0.0171) and among men (men: 1{$\cdot$}235 [1{$\cdot$}12\textendash 1{$\cdot$}36], p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001; women: 1{$\cdot$}051 [0{$\cdot$}96\textendash 1{$\cdot$}16], p=0{$\cdot$}3054 for the highest exposure quartile vs the lowest; pinteraction{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Limitations included the cross-sectional study design, non-representativeness of the UK Biobank base population, and potential residual confounding. Interpretation In a UK-wide study, we found that increased neighbourhood housing density was associated with increased odds of loneliness and social isolation. High density environments might exacerbate unwanted social contacts, resulting in higher social stress and reduced social connections. With more than 65\% of the global population projected to reside in urban areas by 2050, strategic city planning achieved by optimising residential density might constitute a population-wide preventive approach for reducing burdens of loneliness and social isolation.

  abstract = {Urban life has long been pilloried in history for its negative effects on the human condition and mind. From Thomas Jefferson to Emile Durkheim, high density urban living as an aberration to be rectified has been part of the modern discourse on cities. While empirical studies into the psychiatric effects of unwanted social contact began in earnest after WW2 and we now know much about environmental causes of stress, the evidence of the impacts of increasing urban densification upon loneliness and social isolation in humans still remains inconclusive. We employed high-resolution geospatial built environment exposure data to examine associations between residential density and loneliness and social isolation among 405,925 UK Biobank cohort participants. Residential unit density was measured within a 1- and 2-Km residential street network catchment of participant's geocoded dwelling. Other health-specific built environment (i.e., street-level physical walkability, density of public transport, traffic intensity of the nearest road, mean street distance to destinations), and physical environment exposures (terrain variability and greenspace exposure modelled from remotely-sensed data) were also measured at individual-level, within pre-specified catchments of each participant's geocoded dwelling. We found for the UK, that every 1,000 units/km2 increment in residential density within a 1-Km network catchment was independently associated with a 2.8\% (odds ratio: 1.028, p~=~0.0058) and 11.4\% (OR: 1.114, p~{$<~$}0.0001) higher odds of loneliness and social isolation respectively. This can be interpreted as the density elasticity of loneliness (social isolation), which we coin as the Anomie Density Ratio (ADR). In addition, with reference to the lowest density quartile, the fourth-quartile was associated with 14.4\% and 30.4\% higher odds of loneliness and social isolation respectively. The associations were slightly more pronounced at spatial scale of 2-Km, indicating the possibility of a scale effect in this emblematic urban-ill. Higher density of detached housing was negatively associated with both loneliness and social isolation, while density of flats was positively associated with both outcomes. More pronounced effects of residential density on loneliness were identified among males and those retired, while for social isolation, similar effect was observed among the retired. As far as we know, this is the first study to measure the density-loneliness effect using individual (non-ecological) data on a large national sample, controlling for personal confounders and mitigating environmental factors such as green space. Density was associated with loneliness and social isolation independently of other factors, which means that urban design and density planning strategies matter; especially in an age of accelerating suburban densification.},

It applies game mechanics to non-game activities to change the user's behavior of an application. It improves the engagement of user by keeping score of points earned through various activities on the application. The recent gamified websites or a related service such as Foursquare is a location-based application that pinpoints where you are and your activities. Users of the Foursquare can ``check in'' to various locations on their mobile phones and gain incentives like badges or deals. Gamification is utilised as a mean to build up user loyalty, and not so much to gain their long-term engagement. This article discusses how the gamification can help to drive the sustainability after a mobile application has been delivered and is in use. It is important to make mobile application continuously visible and sustainable if the concept of gamification has been used correctly. The more users can gain from the virtual and tangible rewards of using our application, the more we can be rewarded from our users. It also discusses how adding a ``game layer'' has improved the basic functions in society like educating people to become more responsible and helpful and use badges as virtual reward to users who contribute photos.

The pandemic more than doubled the gender loneliness gap: women were lonelier than men in 2017, and the 2017-2020 rise in loneliness was far larger for women. This rise is mirrored in life-satisfaction scores. Men's life satisfaction changed only little between 2017 and 2020; yet that of women fell dramatically, and sufficiently so to produce a female penalty in life satisfaction. We estimate that almost all of this female penalty is explained by the disproportionate rise in loneliness for women during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

However, it is unclear whether social isolation and loneliness had independent and joint associations with incident heart failure (HF). Objectives: This study sought to examine the association of social isolation, loneliness, and their combination with incident HF. Methods: The UK Biobank study is a population-based cohort study. Social isolation and loneliness were assessed using self-reported questionnaires. HF cases were identified by linking hospital records and death registries. The weighted polygenic risk score associated with HF was calculated. Results: Among the 464,773 participants (mean age: 56.5 {$\pm$} 8.1 years, 45.3\% male), 12,898 incident HF cases were documented during a median follow-up of 12.3 years. Social isolation (most vs least: adjusted HR: 1.17; 95\% CI:1.11-1.23) and loneliness (yes vs no: adjusted HR: 1.19; 95\% CI: 1.11-1.27) were significantly associated with an increased risk of incident HF. The association between an elevated risk of HF and social isolation was modified by loneliness (Pinteraction = 0.034). A gradient of association between social isolation and the risk of incident HF was found only among individuals without loneliness (Ptrend {$<$} 0.001), but not among those with loneliness (Ptrend = 0.829). These associations were independent of the genetic risk of HF. Conclusions: Social isolation and loneliness were independently associated with a higher likelihood of incident HF regardless of genetic risk. The association between social isolation and incident HF was potentially modified by loneliness status.},

  abstract = {Drawn from the stress process model, the pandemic has imposed substantial stress to individual economic and mental well-being and has brought unprecedented disruptions to social life. In light of social distancing measures, and in particular physical distancing because of lockdown policies, the use of digital technologies has been regarded as the alternative to maintain economic and social activities. This paper aims to describe the design and implementation of an online survey created as an urgent, international response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The online survey described here responds to the need of understanding the effects of the pandemic on social interactions/relations and to provide findings on the extent to which digital technology is being utilized by citizens across different communities and countries around the world. It also aims to analyze the association of use of digital technologies with psychological well-being and levels of loneliness. The data will be based on the ongoing survey (comprised of several existing and validated instruments on digital use, psychological well-being and loneliness), open for 3 months after roll out (ends September) across 11 countries (Austria, France, Germany, India, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Turkey, and UK). Participants include residents aged 18 years and older in the countries and snowball sampling is employed via social media platforms. We anticipate that the findings of the survey will provide useful and much needed information on the prevalence of use and intensities of digital technologies among different age groups, gender, socioeconomic groups in a comparative perspective. Moreover, we expect that the future analysis of the data collected will show that different types of digital technologies and intensities of use are associated with psychological well-being and loneliness. To conclude, these findings from the study are expected to bring in our understanding the role of digital technologies in affecting individual social and emotional connections during a crisis.},

(Behav Inf Technol 22(6):397\textendash 409, 2003) as a well-documented exemplar. We then examine in more detail some of the difficulties one can encounter in performing user-centred design (UCD), illuminating these issues through vignettes from specific projects in which we have been involved. In this paper, we focus on issues that can arise in working with children and with people of differing mental abilities. Our argument is that, while a user-centred perspective is required at all times in the design team, the forms of participation of users in the design process needs to fit the context and can vary significantly from that presented as the prototypical UCD approach.},

  abstract = {Physical inactivity is a plague for public health, especially in Western Countries. Among the countermeasures, mobile applications promoting physical activity seem particularly promising, thanks to the spread and adoption of mobile devices. However, the dropout rates of users are high, thereby calling for strategies to increase retention rates. Moreover, user testing can be problematic, because it is typically conducted in a laboratory, leading to a limited ecological validity. In the present research, we developed a custom mobile app to promote physical activity. Three versions of the app were implemented, each featuring a different pattern of gamification elements. Moreover, the app was designed to work as a self-managed experimental platform. A remote field study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the different versions of the app. Behavioral log data of physical activity and interaction with the app were collected. Our results show the feasibility of using a mobile app running on personal devices as an independently managed experimental platform. Moreover, we found that gamification elements per se do not ensure higher retention rates, rather it emerged that the richer combination of gamified elements was effective.},

We explored the relationship between social isolation and mortality in a nationally representative US sample and compared the predictive power of social isolation with that of traditional clinical risk factors., Methods. We used data on 16\,849 adults from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Death Index. Predictor variables were 4 social isolation factors and a composite index. Comparison predictors included smoking, obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Unadjusted Kaplan\textendash Meier tables and Cox proportional hazards regression models controlling for sociodemographic characteristics were used to predict mortality., Results. Socially isolated men and women had worse unadjusted survival curves than less socially isolated individuals. Cox models revealed that social isolation predicted mortality for both genders, as did smoking and high blood pressure. Among men, individual social predictors included being unmarried, participating infrequently in religious activities, and lacking club or organization affiliations; among women, significant predictors were being unmarried, infrequent social contact, and participating infrequently in religious activities., Conclusions. The strength of social isolation as a predictor of mortality is similar to that of well-documented clinical risk factors. Our results suggest the importance of assessing patients' level of social isolation.},

A sample of 1806 participants in popular urban races in the city of Valencia was interviewed using an 11-item questionnaire on commitment to running, sociodemographic characteristics, and sports habits. The psychometric properties of the running-commitment scale allowed for the identification of two factors in commitment to running: enthusiasm for running (6 items) and affliction from running (5 items). Subsequently, a cluster analysis combining hierarchical and non-hierarchical methods was performed, identifying three groups of runners: highly committed (n = 650), moderately committed (n = 749), and slightly committed (n = 407). Highly committed runners positively rate all aspects of running enthusiasm (M = 4.15), while moderately committed runners show a more neutral attitude (M = 3.41) and slightly committed runners disagree on these aspects (M = 2.41). Both highly (M = 1.32) and moderately (M = 2.04) committed runners disagree on the affliction-related aspects of running, while slightly committed runners show a trend towards neutrality on some affliction indicators. The variables referring to age, level of studies, sports habits, and running addiction contributed to differentiating the identified groups.},

Worldwide, individuals experienced prolonged periods of isolation during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic when authorities-imposed restrictions to reduce the spread of the virus. In this study, we investigated the effects of social isolation on emotional and behavioral outcomes in young adults from Lombardy, Italy, a global hotspot of COVID-19. We leveraged baseline (pre-social isolation) and follow-up (mid- or post-isolation) data collected from young adults enrolled in the ongoing, longitudinal Public Health Impact of Metals Exposure (PHIME) study. At baseline, 167 participants completed the ASEBA questionnaires (ASR/YSR) by web link or in person; 65 completed the ASR 12\textendash 18 weeks after the onset of restrictions. Using the sign test and multiple linear regression models, we examined differences in ASR scores between baseline and follow-up adjusting for sex, age, pre-pandemic IQ and time with social restrictions (weeks). Further, we examined interactions between sex and time in social isolation. Participants completed the ASR after spending an average of 14 weeks in social isolation (range 12\textendash 18 weeks). Thought problems increased between baseline and follow-up (median difference 1.0; 1st, 3rd quartile: -1.0, 4.0; p = 0.049). Among males, a longer time in social isolation ({$\geq$}14 weeks) was associated with increased rule-breaking behaviors of 2.8 points. These results suggest the social isolation related to COVID-19 adversely impacted mental health. In particular, males seem to externalize their condition. These findings might help future interventions and treatment to minimize the consequences of social isolation experience in young adults.},

Gamification, which emerges with the idea of increasing motivation by using game elements, is used in many fields such as work, education, health, personal development and marketing. In people's real lives, they can loss weight, learn language, sales increase and so on motivation in line with many goals and take action and change behavior. Gamification; especially, in the growing mobile application market with the increase in the use of smart phones is the new choice of companies. Gamification is a technique which used to increase the loyalty, motivation and productivity of users in mobile applications. In this way, a more interesting and enjoyable experience for the user can be provided. Gamification, which attracted the attention of researchers and academics, has been the subject of many researches and studies. The purpose of this is the benefits of gamification over the engagement between users and the interface design and the experience. In line with this aim, elements related to the concept of gamification, models and related motivational theories are explained in detail and the elements that should be considered for a qualified and usable user interface (UI) design are examined. The usage rate and appreciation rate of educational mobile applications using gamification were selected and the effect of gamification on the usability of interface design was evaluated. As a result of this study, the interface design of a new application called "Quistudy", which uses the elements of gamification in order to improve usability and development, has been designed. The usability tests of the application were performed and the success rate of the interface design was measured. In this manner, the effect of gamification usage on interface design in educational mobile applications and the contribution of interface design to effective use of gamification elements were evaluated.},

The current study investigates whether ethnic differences in emotional and social loneliness between Moroccan, Turkish, Surinamese and Dutch adults living in the Netherlands are due to ethnic differences in the presence and/or impact of an array of possible risk factors, such as partnership, health and socioeconomic status. Methods: The data were collected in 2012 as a part of a general health questionnaire of the Public Health Services in the four major cities of the Netherlands, containing 20.047 Dutch, 1.043 Moroccan, 1.197 Turkish and 1.900 Surinamese respondents. Results: Structural equation models showed that ethnic differences in emotional and social loneliness can be ascribed to ethnic differences in the prevalence and impact of several risk factors. Main findings were that all three ethnic minority groups reported feeling less healthy and more discriminated against than the Dutch group, which was related to increased loneliness. Perceived financial difficulties and people in the neighbourhood not getting along had more impact on feelings of loneliness for the Turkish group than loneliness for the other ethnic groups. Furthermore, members of the Turkish group were found more at risk to feel anxious or depressed, which was in turn related to increased loneliness. Conclusions: Policy makers are encouraged to develop multifaceted prevention strategies concerning those risk factors that are most changeable, thereby focusing per risk factor on those ethnic groups for which it is an important contribution to loneliness.},

The purpose of this study is to investigate the interaction pattern of the urban running community and the behavior pattern of runners with the help of social interaction theory, and to explore the inner connection between their community movement and social interaction. Ten senior members of marathon urban running societies were selected to conduct two rounds of in-depth interviews which were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis to understand the sports participation experiences and social interactions of running society members. The study found that the whole interaction process of running groups is accomplished through three aspects: examination of self, adjustment with reference to others, and a sense of group belonging as the core consciousness. On the other hand, the social attributes of running groups can advance the personalization process of runners in society, which is mainly characterized by self-presentation and external constraints, self-requirement and group constraints, intergroup interaction and group identity reorganization. In addition, the unique community culture, standardized group organization and harmonious activity atmosphere will stimulate runners' interest in running, strengthen community communication and establish stable community relations, etc., which in turn will bring about continuous interactive behaviors.},
