## Scope
The focus is set on seeking a solution to propose a common date and time meeting for a running session with multiple users.
Only urban individuals from medium and large cities are targeted. A unique real city will be selected to develop the project around.

The application development is limited to smartphones and does not include desktop computers as well as wearable devices (smartwatches, sports devices).
Design and user experience will be limited to the application itself and its uses, from installing the application to booking or creating a session.
The real-world experience of meeting, the running sessions with partners, and the resulting user satisfaction of this experience are out of scope.

Furthermore, the following elements are not included in the scope of work :

- Performance measures for athletes
- Running contests
- Fitness and health orientation
- Individual dating
- Augmented reality location-based game
