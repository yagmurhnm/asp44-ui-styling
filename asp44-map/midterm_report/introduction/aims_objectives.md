## Aims and objectives
Before building the application, this preliminary work will aim to :

- Analyse the current market, including social, sports, and location-based game applications
- Validate from users the concept of a map with predefined routes
- Build a pleasing and effective prototype of the user interface for smartphones
- Evaluate and ensure the good usability of the solution
- Define a precise list of requirements and specifications
- Reflect on the process and how it could have been improved
  
The main goal is to obtain a well-defined minimum viable product ready to be implemented in the second phase of the project.
