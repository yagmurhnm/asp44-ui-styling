## Existing solutions
Various existing applications partially answer this study's problem space.
They can be categorized into three different groups :

1. **Social applications to make new friends and organise events** \newline
   Their aim is precisely to trigger in-person meetings, and they answer the current topic's problem. However, they suffer from different flaws.
   They gather people who do not have a particular common interest, making the start of interaction and the icebreaking step difficult.
   Most of these applications are falsely used as dating apps, which is not their primary purpose.
2. **Sports applications to track performances** \newline
   This category mainly focuses on monitoring the runner's performance and is strongly oriented toward athletes.
   There is no emphasis on the social dimension, and activities are generally shared within a limited circle of friends,
   not expanding through strangers.
3. **Location-based game using the public space** \newline
   The focus is set on the game dimension with the primary goal of entertaining individual players.
   The design is not oriented to produce social interactions.

Addressing issues from these products and highlighting existing gaps in the market space brings a new approach to the problem.
