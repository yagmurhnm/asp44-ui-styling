## Approach and concept
This project will explore how technology can be used to build a tool sparking opportunities for real-life meetings between individuals.
What makes the proposed approach innovative is the use of sport as a medium to serve the opportunity of meeting new people
while engaging users through gamification. None of the existing solutions use this specific combination.

The proposed concept is an analogy to subway and bus networks. Vehicle transportation are replaced by groups of runners.
Sessions are booked at a particular time from running station A to running station B
on a predefined set of routes forming a network. This network will be materialized by a map.
The sum of all existing sessions on a given route will form a timetable. Stations are fictive and do not exist in the real world.
They are virtually created around existing monuments or distinctive places in the city.

The choice of predefined routes constrains users to share a common space at a given time, thus opening a space for interactions with other users.
They will share the same goal of reaching a station together through their journey.
Previous studies on location-based games will drive the design to bring a more interactive experience with enhanced user engagement.[@bitrianarcasEnhancingUserEngagement2021; @cottonGamificationUseDesign2018; @gohGamificationEffectiveMotivating2015; @kariGamifyNotGamify2016; @martinezExploitingMobileGamification2023]

The extensive existing literature on the three pre-cited categories of the project will constitute the primary data source.
Additional quantitative and qualitative data will be gathered through questionnaires and observations.
