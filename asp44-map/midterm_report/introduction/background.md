## Background
Social relationships are a vital aspect for human beings.[@liangAssociationSocialIsolation2023; @pantellSocialIsolationPredictor2013]
The COVID-19 pandemic has highly reduced interactions between people. It shed light on loneliness and social isolation issues.
Despite a temporary decline in loneliness following the end of the pandemic,
the phenomenon remains high and follows the global rising trend observed over the past 40 years.[@LonelinessEpidemicPersists]

Various factors have been studied to identify the circumstances under which the feeling of loneliness is more likely to occur.
Some evidence of associations has been shown on age as well as socioeconomics.[@LonelinessEpidemicPersists; @bruceLonelinessUnitedStates2019]
Loneliness significantly impacts younger people[@LonelinessYoungPeople], and it is worth noting that the geographic variable also
plays a significant role. A strong correlation between population density and loneliness has been evidenced in urban areas.[@laiCalculatingNationalAnomie2021]
