## Applications analysis
Testing and using existing applications allows a better understanding of what competitors are offering and give insights on different questions like :

- What kind of features are proposed ?
- What parts of the application are running smoothly and effectively ?
- How is the interface structured ?
- How do users interact with the application ?

A quick analysis of the following applications has been conducted :

| Social application | Sport application | Location-based game |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Friender           | Strava            | Munzee              |
| Knockk             | Nike Run Club     | Geocaching          |
| We3                | Map my run        | Pokemon GO          |

The screenshots below capture interesting features and interfaces from each application.
