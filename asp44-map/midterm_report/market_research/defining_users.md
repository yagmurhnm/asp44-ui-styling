## Defining users
Users are defined after gathering data from five different sources, including research papers, a market study, and a survey analysis :

*Nielsen sports study does not provide much detail on the methodology used to collect data.
The report claims to have conducted 8414 interviews. However, observing the nature of the outcomes, it is more likely to be an online survey.

After reading these papers, the following facts can be highlighted :

- As much men as women practice running
- Most of the runners are aged from 35 to 50 years old
- A significant part of the population has high education and high incomes
- Being healthy and willing to exercise is the main reason to practice running
- Fun and social togetherness also constitute fundamental motives for this activity

These characteristics give a precise outline of the users to target.
However, this profiling process should not be limited to runners and should be extended to the population experiencing loneliness,
as shown in the introduction. For this reason, the age range will be shifted to 25-40 to overlap
with the prevalence of loneliness.

The analysis from Neil Baxter reveals that running activities "somehow excludes less privileged people".[@KeyRunningStatistics]
This is a critical point to address as the application's goal is to be widely accessible. It will require understanding the underpinning reasons.
However, gamification provides a more engaging and entertaining experience
that allows both to catch younger users under 30 years old and trigger an interest in non-runners.
This evidence strengthens the crossover strategy between social, sport, and game.

Finally, the population can be categorized into three groups :

- Non-runners
- Recreational runners
- Competitive runners

Competitive runners will not be included in the user target because they have specific needs oriented to performance tracking
which are already covered by many applications on the market.
